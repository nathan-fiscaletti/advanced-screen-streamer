## Overview

When it comes to video conferencing, screen sharing is a critical feature that enables remote teams to collaborate effectively. However, the limitations of conventional screen sharing options can hinder this collaboration. For instance, if you're working on multiple windows simultaneously, you may need to switch between them while sharing your screen. In such cases, the inability to share multiple windows at once without sharing your entire desktop can be a significant drawback. Similarly, if you need to add another window to the stream, you have to re-share your screen, which can be disruptive and inconvenient.

FrameCast provides a way to overcome these limitations by allowing you to share a specific region of your screen instead of the entire screen or a single window. This can help you avoid distractions and maintain a focused, streamlined presentation. Additionally, it enables you to share multiple windows simultaneously without the need to re-share your screen, enhancing your ability to collaborate with others.

The application works by using [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/), an open-source video and audio processing software, to stream a portion of your screen to a separate window that you can then select for sharing in your video conferencing application. The viewer window is fully customizable, allowing you to adjust its size, position, bit-rate and frame-rate to suit your preferences.

**This is especially useful when you are running on an Ultrawide display.**
